<h1>Project: SSH</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will understand better what is a server and SSH, and how to create an SSH RSA key pair.</strong></p>
<body>
<li>Task 0: Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/holberton with the user ubuntu.</li>
<li>Task 1: Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.</li>
<li>Task 2: Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, let’s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.</li>
<li>Task 3: Add the SSH public key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.</li>
<li>Advanced Task 1: Let’s practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file. Just as in the previous configuration file task, we’d like you to set up your client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.</li>
