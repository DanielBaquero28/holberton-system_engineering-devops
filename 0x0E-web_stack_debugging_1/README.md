<h1>Project: Web Stack Debugging 1</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will learn how to debug an nginx web server that is listening on port 80.</strong></p>
<body>
<li>Task 0: Using your debugging skills, find out what’s keeping your Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the issue. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.</li>
<li>Advanced Task 1: Using what you did for task #0, make your fix short and sweet.
Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Your Bash script must be 5 lines long or less</li>
<li>There must be a new line at the end of the file</li>
<li>You must respect usual Bash script requirements</li>
<li>You cannot use ;</li>
<li>You cannot use &&</li>
<li>You cannot use wget</li>
<li>You cannot execute your previous answer file (Do not include the name of the previous script in this one)</li>
<li>service (init) must say that nginx is not running ← for real</li>
</ul>
</li>
