<li>Task 0: Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response-header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task</li>
<li>Task 1: Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.</li>
<li>Advanced Task 1: Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.</li>
