<h1>Project: Web Stack Debugging #3</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we'll review once more tools to debug, in this case it'll be strace as a debugger of a wordpress site having an http 500 error</strong></p>
<body>
<li>Task 0: Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).
<ul>Requirements:
<li>Your 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp file must contain Puppet code</li>
<li>You can use whatever Puppet resource type you want for you fix</li>
</ul>
</li>
