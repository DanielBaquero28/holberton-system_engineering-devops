<h1>Project:</h1>
<p><strong>In this project we will review once again a bad web stack which we'll have to debug to find how to fix it.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Task 0:</strong> For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time. We can see that 943 requests failed, letâ€™s fix our stack so that we get to 0, and remember that when something is going wrong, logs are your best friends!</li>
